Fix the following code based on validation or execution errors.

ORIGINAL CODE:
{code}

ERRORS TO FIX:
{errors}

TOOL SPEC:
{spec}

COMMON ERROR PATTERNS AND FIXES:
1. "complex() first argument must be a string or a number, not 'list'" → You're trying to do math with a list instead of numbers. Use numeric operations on list items, not the list itself.
2. "name 'X' is not defined" → Missing import statement. Add the correct import at the top.
3. "list object has no attribute 'mean'" → Lists don't have .mean(). Use numpy: np.mean(list) or pandas: pd.Series(list).mean()
4. "'list' object is not callable" → You're calling a list like a function. Check for misnamed variables.

Instructions:
1. Read the ERRORS carefully - they tell you exactly what's wrong
2. If error mentions a missing function/module, add the import
3. If error mentions wrong data type, convert or process the data correctly
4. Maintain the original functionality and purpose
5. Keep the function signature: def function_name(file_path: str):
6. Ensure code follows best practices
7. Add any missing error handling
8. Return a dictionary with 'result' and 'metadata' keys
9. Test your logic: if you're grouping data and need to calculate mean, use proper pandas/numpy methods

CRITICAL FOR STATISTICAL FUNCTIONS:
- After groupby().apply(list), you have a Series where each value is a list
- To calculate statistics on groups: Use grouped.mean(), grouped.std(), etc. - NOT grouped.apply(list).mean()
- For ANOVA on groups: Extract each group as a list, then pass to f_oneway(*groups)
- For group statistics: Use the aggregation functions directly on the grouped object

IMPORTANT: Use {{}} or dict() to create dictionaries. Do NOT import or use typing classes.

DO NOT INCLUDE:
- DO NOT create placeholder decorator functions
- DO NOT create mock FastMCP classes
- DO NOT write explanatory text before or after the code
- DO NOT write "Here's the fixed code:" or conversational text

ONLY OUTPUT:
- The complete corrected function with all imports
- Make sure imports are at the top (scipy, statsmodels, numpy, etc.)
- The function must return a dictionary

Return ONLY the corrected code (imports + function). Nothing else.
